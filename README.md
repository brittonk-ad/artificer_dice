Artificer Dice | Prototype 0

Detects change in accelerometer, then performs a quick light animation and generates a random numer. The LED corresponding to the generated number is then pulsed on HIGH for three seconds while simultaneously reading the accelerometer to prevent a double-read. The LED is then pulsed on LOW for a second to allow for a cooldown.
